# Network & MongoDB Connectivity Report

## Current Status: ❌ Cannot Connect to MongoDB Atlas

### Diagnostics:

**Network Configuration:**

- IPv4: 10.117.234.131
- IPv6: 2401:4900:3e44:7b83:2530:d49e:c515:6b5c
- DNS Server: 10.117.234.192 (Corporate/Institutional)
- Firewall: Windows Defender (All Profiles Enabled)

**Connectivity Tests:**

- ✅ Local network: Working
- ✅ Google.com DNS: Resolves (142.250.67.46)
- ✅ HTTPS Port 443: Open (to Google)
- ❌ MongoDB.net DNS: **Cannot resolve** (blocked)
- ❌ cluster0.yxtklsn.mongodb.net: **Cannot resolve** (blocked)

### Root Cause:

Your network (appears to be corporate/institutional) has DNS filtering enabled that blocks MongoDB Atlas domains. This is a **network-level restriction**, not a firewall rule.

### Solutions:

#### Option A: Use Local MongoDB Community Edition

```bash
# Download from: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
# Or install via chocolatey:
choco install mongodb-community
```

Then change `.env.local`:

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/MySanjeevni
```

#### Option B: Use VPN/Proxy

If available on your network, connect to a VPN that bypasses DNS filtering.

#### Option C: Use Alternative DNS

Change your DNS to public DNS (Google, Cloudflare) - may require admin privileges:

```powershell
# Requires Administrator
Set-DnsClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex X -ServerAddresses 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
```

#### Option D: Contact Network Administrator

Request whitelisting of:

- \*.mongodb.net
- \*.mongodb-cloud.com

#### Option E: Use Mock/In-Memory Database (For Testing Only)

Modify the app to use in-memory storage instead of MongoDB - suitable for development only.

### Recommendation:

**Use Option A (Local MongoDB)** - it's the most reliable and doesn't depend on external network.
