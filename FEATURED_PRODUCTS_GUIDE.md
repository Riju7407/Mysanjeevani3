# Featured Products Section - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This implementation adds a new "Featured Products" section to the homepage that displays brand cards before the hero section. Admins can upload product images (via Cloudinary), manage brand names, and control display order through a dedicated admin panel.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Database Model**

- **File:** `src/lib/models/FeaturedProduct.ts`
- Schema includes:
  - `brandName`: String (required) - Brand name to display
  - `imageUrl`: String (required) - Cloudinary URL of the image
  - `cloudinaryPublicId`: String - For deleting images from Cloudinary
  - `displayOrder`: Number - For sorting products on homepage
  - `isActive`: Boolean - To toggle visibility
  - `createdBy`: String - Admin user ID who created it
  - Timestamps auto-added (createdAt, updatedAt)

### 2. **API Endpoints**

#### Get Featured Products (Public)

```
GET /api/featured-products
```

Returns all active featured products sorted by displayOrder.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "_id": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
      "brandName": "Brand Name",
      "imageUrl": "https://cloudinary.com/...",
      "displayOrder": 0,
      "isActive": true,
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Create Featured Product (Admin Only)

```
POST /api/featured-products
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {adminToken}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "brandName": "Brand Name",
  "imageUrl": "https://cloudinary.com/...",
  "displayOrder": 0,
  "createdBy": "admin-user-id"
}
```

Headers: Authorization: Bearer {adminToken}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "brandName": "New Brand Name",
  "displayOrder": 1,
  "imageUrl": "https://..."  // optional if not changing image
}
```

#### Delete Featured Product (Admin Only)

```
DELETE /api/featured-products/{id}
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {adminToken}
```

### 3. **Image Upload Endpoint**

- **File:** `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`
- Handles base64 image uploads to Cloudinary
- Supports custom folder parameter
- Auto-converts to WebP format for optimization

```

CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

## Styling & Responsive Design

- **Grid Columns:**
  - Mobile (< 640px): 1 column
  - Tablet (640px - 1024px): 2 columns
  - Desktop (> 1024px): 4 columns
- **Theme:** Blue gradient with consistent MySanjeevni branding
- **Animations:** Smooth hover effects, fade-in loading states

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **Reordering:** Drag-and-drop to reorder products
2. **Categories:** Group featured products by category
3. **Analytics:** Track featured product views/clicks
4. **Scheduling:** Set date ranges for automatic display
5. **A/B Testing:** Compare featured product performance
6. **Linked Products:** Connect to specific medicine/lab test products

## Troubleshooting

### Products not showing on homepage?

- Check if products are marked as `isActive: true`
- Verify Cloudinary credentials in `.env.local`
- Check browser console for API errors

### Image upload failing?

- Ensure image file < 5MB
- Verify Cloudinary credentials
- Check network tab for upload response

### Admin can't access management page?

- Verify admin authentication token in localStorage
- Check `adminAuthMiddleware` configuration
- Ensure user has admin role
