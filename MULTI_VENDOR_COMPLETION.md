## Technical Specifications

### Security Features

- ✅ Password hashing (SHA256)
- ✅ Ownership verification (vendor can only manage their products)
- ✅ Status-based access control (only verified vendors can add products)
- ✅ JWT-like token system (UUID) for vendor sessions
- ✅ Admin-only endpoints for vendor management

### Database Structure

```
Vendors Collection:
- Index on email (unique)
- Index on vendorName (unique)
- Index on status (for filtering)
- Index on createdAt (for sorting)

Products Collection:
- Updated with vendorId foreign key
- Updated with vendorName and vendorRating fields
```

### Performance Considerations

- Vendor products fetched on demand
- Filters applied client-side on medicines page
- Pagination ready for future implementation
- Indexed queries for vendor status filtering
